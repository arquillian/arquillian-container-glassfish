This directory is meant to be a Glassfish instanceRoot. As of Glassfish 3.1, this is expected to contain the following two sub-directories:

* config
* docroot

It also contains a domain.xml within the config dir, for the purpose of verifying conflict between the instanceRoot and configurationXml values.
